Arrival inbound efficiency: This indicator
measures the arrival delay at the airport after
removing ATFM regulations (e.g. ground
holding), and if possible inbound flight delay,
from the measurement. Thus, it shows if the
airport is able to deal with the incoming flights
without causing delays.
Departure outbound efficiency: This indicator
measures the pre-departure delays at the airport,
after the possible removal of delays not caused
at/by the airport. It indicates whether the airport is
able to process the flights in a timely manner.
Turnaround times in the apron/gate area: This
indicator measures the average turnaround times
(the time required for activities from landing until
the aircraft can take off again) in the apron/gate
area. It can be appropriately used in benchmarks,
and whe
